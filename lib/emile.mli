(** Emile module, parser of e-mail address. *)

(** An e-mail address can contain as a part of a {!phrase} (identifier) an
    encoded string. Standards describe 2 kinds of encoding:

    - Quoted Printable: used to insert hexadecimal value with the [=] operator.
    - Base 64: string encoded in MIME's Base64

    Parser already decodes encoded {!raw}, the client can use it as is. *)
type raw =
  | Quoted_printable of (string, [ `Msg of string ]) result

type word = [ `Atom of string | `String of string ]
(** The local part of an e-mail address is composed by two kinds of {i word}s:

    - [`Atom] is string as is.
    - [`String] is a string surrounded by double-quote to allow white-space.

    The second kind is sanitized — we deleted double-quote which surround
    [string]. *)

type local = word list
(** Local part of e-mail address. *)

(** Subset of domain described by RFC5321 which contains 3 kinds of address:

    - [IPv4]: a valid IPv4 address
    - [IPv6]: a valid IPv6 address
    - [Ext (ldh, value)]: an extended kind of domain recognized by [ldh]
      identifier which valus is [value]

    Parser of [IPv4] and [IPv6] was done by [Ipaddr]. An extended kind [Ext]
    needs to be resolved by the client. *)

  | Ext of (string * string)

type domain = [ `Domain of string list | `Addr of addr | `Literal of string ]
(** Domain part of e-mail address. A domain integrate kinds from RFC5321 (see
    {!addr}), a domain described by RFC5322 and a [`Literal] which is the last
    {i best-effort} value possible as a domain.

    [Emile] {b does not} resolve domain. *)

type phrase = [ `Dot | `Word of word | `Encoded of string * raw ] list
(** A phrase is a sentence to associate a name with an e-mail address or a group
    of e-mail addresses. [`Encoded] value {b is not} normalized on the
    {i charset} specified. The encoded's string is decoded as is only. For
    example, [`Encoded] can inform to use KOI-8 encoding (cyrillic charset).
    However, [Emile] does not check if value is a valid KOI-8 string, nor
    normalizes to unicode. [Emile] just decodes it as is. *)

          (2) An encoded-word may appear within a comment delimited by "(" and
              ")", i.e., wherever a "ctext" is allowed.  More precisely, the
              RFC 822 ABNF definition for "comment" is amended as follows:

              comment = "(" *(ctext / quoted-pair / comment / encoded-word) ")"

              A "Q"-encoded encoded-word which appears in a comment MUST NOT
              contain the characters "(", ")" or DQUOTE encoded-word that
              appears in a "comment" MUST be separated from any adjacent
              encoded-word or "ctext" by linear-white-space.

        7. Conformance

          A mail reading program claiming compliance with this specification
          must be able to distinguish encoded-words from "text", "ctext", or
          "word"s, according to the rules in section 6, anytime they appear in
          appropriate places in message headers.  It must support both the "B"

        Each header field can be viewed as a single, logical  line  of
        ASCII  characters,  comprising  a field-name and a field-body.
        For convenience, the field-body  portion  of  this  conceptual
        entity  can be split into a multiple-line representation; this
        is called "folding".  The general rule is that wherever  there
        may  be  linear-white-space  (NOT  simply  LWSP-chars), a CRLF
        immediately followed by AT LEAST one LWSP-char may instead  be
        inserted.  Thus, the single line

            To:  "Joe & J. Harvey" <ddd @Org>, JJV @ BBN

        can be represented as:

            To:  "Joe & J. Harvey" <ddd @ Org>,
                    JJV@BBN

        and

            To:  "Joe & J. Harvey"
                            <ddd@ Org>, JJV
             @BBN

        and

            To:  "Joe &
             J. Harvey" <ddd @ Org>, JJV @ BBN

             The process of moving  from  this  folded   multiple-line
        representation  of a header field to its single line represen-
        tation is called "unfolding".  Unfolding  is  accomplished  by
        regarding   CRLF   immediately  followed  by  a  LWSP-char  as
        equivalent to the LWSP-char.

        Note:  While the standard  permits  folding  wherever  linear-
               white-space is permitted, it is recommended that struc-
               tured fields, such as those containing addresses, limit
               folding  to higher-level syntactic breaks.  For address
               fields, it  is  recommended  that  such  folding  occur
               between addresses, after the separating comma.

        The local-part of an  addr-spec  in  a  mailbox  specification
        (i.e.,  the  host's  name for the mailbox) is understood to be
        whatever the receiving mail protocol server allows.  For exam-
        ple,  some systems do not understand mailbox references of the
        form "P. D. Q. Bach", but others do.

        This specification treats periods (".") as lexical separators.
        Hence,  their  presence  in  local-parts which are not quoted-
        strings, is detected.   However,  such  occurrences  carry  NO
        semantics.  That is, if a local-part has periods within it, an
        address parser will divide the local-part into several tokens,
        but  the  sequence  of  tokens will be treated as one uninter-
        preted unit.  The sequence  will  be  re-assembled,  when  the
        address is passed outside of the system such as to a mail pro-
        tocol service.

        For example, the address:

                           First.Last@Registry.Org

        is legal and does not require the local-part to be  surrounded
        with  quotation-marks.   (However,  "First  Last" DOES require
        quoting.)  The local-part of the address, when passed  outside
        of  the  mail  system,  within  the  Registry.Org  domain,  is
        "First.Last", again without quotation marks.

        6.2.1.  DOMAINS

        A name-domain is a set of registered (mail)  names.   A  name-
        domain  specification  resolves  to  a subordinate name-domain
        specification  or  to  a  terminal  domain-dependent   string.
        Hence,  domain  specification  is  extensible,  permitting any
        number of registration levels.

        Name-domains model a global, logical, hierarchical  addressing
        scheme.   The  model is logical, in that an address specifica-
        tion is related to name registration and  is  not  necessarily
        tied  to  transmission  path.   The  model's  hierarchy  is  a
        directed graph, called an in-tree, such that there is a single
        path  from  the root of the tree to any node in the hierarchy.
        If more than one path actually exists, they are considered  to
        be different addresses.

        The root node is common to all addresses; consequently, it  is
        not  referenced.   Its  children  constitute "top-level" name-
        domains.  Usually, a service has access to its own full domain
        specification and to the names of all top-level name-domains.

        The "top" of the domain addressing hierarchy -- a child of the
        root  --  is  indicated  by  the right-most field, in a domain
        specification.  Its child is specified to the left, its  child
        to the left, and so on.

        Some groups provide formal registration services;  these  con-
        stitute   name-domains   that  are  independent  logically  of
        specific machines.  In addition, networks and machines  impli-
        citly  compose name-domains, since their membership usually is
        registered in name tables.

        In the case of formal registration, an organization implements
        a  (distributed)  data base which provides an address-to-route
        mapping service for addresses of the form:

                         person@registry.organization

        Note that "organization" is a logical  entity,  separate  from
        any particular communication network.

        A mechanism for accessing "organization" is universally avail-
        able.   That mechanism, in turn, seeks an instantiation of the
        registry; its location is not indicated in the address specif-
        ication.   It  is assumed that the system which operates under
        the name "organization" knows how to find a subordinate regis-
        try.  The registry will then use the "person" string to deter-
        mine where to send the mail specification.

        The latter,  network-oriented  case  permits  simple,  direct,
        attachment-related address specification, such as:

                              user@host.network

        Once the network is accessed, it is expected  that  a  message
        will  go  directly  to the host and that the host will resolve
        the user name, placing the message in the user's mailbox.

        6.2.2.  ABBREVIATED DOMAIN SPECIFICATION

        Since any number of  levels  is  possible  within  the  domain
        hierarchy,  specification  of  a  fully  qualified address can
        become inconvenient.  This standard permits abbreviated domain
        specification, in a special case:

            For the address of  the  sender,  call  the  left-most
            sub-domain  Level  N.   In a header address, if all of
            the sub-domains above (i.e., to the right of) Level  N
            are  the same as those of the sender, then they do not
            have to appear in the specification.   Otherwise,  the
            address must be fully qualified.

            This feature is subject  to  approval  by  local  sub-
            domains.   Individual  sub-domains  may  require their
            member systems, which originate mail, to provide  full
            domain  specification only.  When permitted, abbrevia-
            tions may be present  only  while  the  message  stays
            within the sub-domain of the sender.

            Use of this mechanism requires the sender's sub-domain
            to reserve the names of all top-level domains, so that
            full specifications can be distinguished from abbrevi-
            ated specifications.

        For example, if a sender's address is:

                 sender@registry-A.registry-1.organization-X

        and one recipient's address is:

                recipient@registry-B.registry-1.organization-X

        and another's is:

                recipient@registry-C.registry-2.organization-X

        then ".registry-1.organization-X" need not be specified in the
        the  message,  but  "registry-C.registry-2"  DOES  have  to be
        specified.  That is, the first two addresses may  be  abbrevi-
        ated, but the third address must be fully specified.

        When a message crosses a domain boundary, all  addresses  must
        be  specified  in  the  full format, ending with the top-level
        name-domain in the right-most field.  It is the responsibility
        of  mail  forwarding services to ensure that addresses conform
        with this requirement.  In the case of abbreviated  addresses,
        the  relaying  service must make the necessary expansions.  It
        should be noted that it often is difficult for such a  service
        to locate all occurrences of address abbreviations.  For exam-
        ple, it will not be possible to find such abbreviations within
        the  body  of  the  message.   The "Return-Path" field can aid
        recipients in recovering from these errors.

        Note:  When passing any portion of an addr-spec onto a process
               which  does  not interpret data according to this stan-
               dard (e.g., mail protocol servers).  There must  be  NO
               LWSP-chars  preceding  or  following the at-sign or any
               delimiting period ("."), such as  shown  in  the  above
               examples,   and   only  ONE  SPACE  between  contiguous
               <word>s.

        6.2.3.  DOMAIN TERMS

        A domain-ref must be THE official name of a registry, network,
        or  host.   It  is  a  symbolic  reference, within a name sub-
        domain.  At times, it is necessary to bypass standard  mechan-
        isms  for  resolving  such  references,  using  more primitive
        information, such as a network host address  rather  than  its
        associated host name.

        To permit such references, this standard provides the  domain-
        literal  construct.   Its contents must conform with the needs
        of the sub-domain in which it is interpreted.

        Domain-literals which refer to domains within the ARPA  Inter-
        net  specify  32-bit  Internet addresses, in four 8-bit fields
        noted in decimal, as described in Request for  Comments  #820,
        "Assigned Numbers."  For example:

                                 [10.0.3.19]

        Note:  THE USE OF DOMAIN-LITERALS IS STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.  It
               is  permitted  only  as  a means of bypassing temporary
               system limitations, such as name tables which  are  not
               complete.

        The names of "top-level" domains, and  the  names  of  domains
        under  in  the  ARPA Internet, are registered with the Network
        Information Center, SRI International, Menlo Park, California.

        Update:
        + Removed no-fold-quote from msg-id.  Clarified syntax

        The message identifier (msg-id) itself MUST be a globally unique
        identifier for a message.  The generator of the message identifier
        MUST guarantee that the msg-id is unique.  There are several
        algorithms that can be used to accomplish this.  Since the msg-id has
        a similar syntax to addr-spec (identical except that quoted strings,
        comments, and folding white space are not allowed), a good method is
        to put the domain name (or a domain literal IP address) of the host
        on which the message identifier was created on the right-hand side of
        the "@" (since domain names and IP addresses are normally unique),
        and put a combination of the current absolute date and time along
        with some other currently unique (perhaps sequential) identifier
        available on the system (for example, a process id number) on the
        left-hand side.  Though other algorithms will work, it is RECOMMENDED
        that the right-hand side contain some domain identifier (either of
        the host itself or otherwise) such that the generator of the message
        identifier can guarantee the uniqueness of the left-hand side within
        the scope of that domain.

        Semantically, the angle bracket characters are not part of the
        msg-id; the msg-id is what is contained between the two angle bracket
        characters.
