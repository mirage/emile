(* Equal *)

(* XXX(dinosaure): CFWS (useless white space and comment) are already deleted by
   parser below.

   However, some parts are semantically equal, like:
   - raw with base64 encoding or quoted-printable encoding: if produced content
   is equal, these values are semantically equal
   - order of domains (RFC did not explain any specific process about order of
   domains)
   - RFC 1034 explains domains are case-insensitive
   - IPv4 could be equal to a subset of IPv6
   - [`Atom] and [`String] could be semantically equal (it's a /word/) (RFC 5321
   explains local-part - which contains /word/ - SHOULD be case-sensitive)

   So, for all of these, we implement two kinds of [equal]:
   - a strict implementation which strictly checks if two addresses are equal
   structurally
   - a semantic implementation which follows rules above *)

  (* XXX(dinosaure): about each comment, because we don't have a software to
     prove these implementations, we check all /tokens/ by hands. All
     occurrences of token in RFCs appears: ABNF and comments. It's useful to not
     forget something when we implement them. It's little annoying to do this
     but some crazy people have the power to decide about how to write an
     e-mail - not my fault.

     Then, a dependence /by hands/ again show you why we need to implement
     token.

     Finally, a little comment by the implementor to explain what we have and
     what we _don't_ have. *)

       5. Use of encoded-words in message headers

         (2) An encoded-word may appear within a comment delimited by "(" and
             ")", i.e., wherever a "ctext" is allowed.  More precisely, the
             RFC 822 ABNF definition for "comment" is amended as follows:

             comment = "(" *(ctext / quoted-pair / comment / encoded-word) ")"

             A "Q"-encoded encoded-word which appears in a comment MUST NOT
             contain the characters "(", ")" or DQUOTE encoded-word that
             appears in a "comment" MUST be separated from any adjacent
             encoded-word or "ctext" by linear-white-space.

       7. Conformance

         A mail reading program claiming compliance with this specification
         must be able to distinguish encoded-words from "text", "ctext", or
         "word"s, according to the rules in section 6, anytime they appear in
         appropriate places in message headers.  It must support both the "B"
         and "Q" encodings for any character set which it supports.  The
         program must be able to display the unencoded text if the character

     From RFC 2047

       Update from RFC 1522:
       + clarification: an 'encoded-word' may appear immediately following
         the initial "(" or immediately before the final ")" that delimits a
         comment, not just adjacent to "(" and ")" *within* *ctext.

       Each header field can be viewed as a single, logical  line  of
       ASCII  characters,  comprising  a field-name and a field-body.
       For convenience, the field-body  portion  of  this  conceptual
       entity  can be split into a multiple-line representation; this
       is called "folding".  The general rule is that wherever  there
       may  be  linear-white-space  (NOT  simply  LWSP-chars), a CRLF
       immediately followed by AT LEAST one LWSP-char may instead  be
       inserted.  Thus, the single line

           To:  "Joe & J. Harvey" <ddd @Org>, JJV @ BBN

       can be represented as:

           To:  "Joe & J. Harvey" <ddd @ Org>,
                   JJV@BBN

       and

           To:  "Joe & J. Harvey"
                           <ddd@ Org>, JJV
            @BBN

       and

           To:  "Joe &
            J. Harvey" <ddd @ Org>, JJV @ BBN

            The process of moving  from  this  folded   multiple-line
       representation  of a header field to its single line represen-
       tation is called "unfolding".  Unfolding  is  accomplished  by
       regarding   CRLF   immediately  followed  by  a  LWSP-char  as
       equivalent to the LWSP-char.

       Note:  While the standard  permits  folding  wherever  linear-
              white-space is permitted, it is recommended that struc-
              tured fields, such as those containing addresses, limit
              folding  to higher-level syntactic breaks.  For address
              fields, it  is  recommended  that  such  folding  occur
              between addresses, after the separating comma.

     From RFC 2822

       White space characters, including white space used in folding
       (described in section 2.2.3), may appear between many elements in
       header field bodies.  Also, strings of characters that are treated as
       comments may be included in structured field bodies as characters
       enclosed in parentheses.  The following defines the folding white
       space (FWS) and comment constructs.

       Strings of characters enclosed in parentheses are considered comments
       so long as they do not appear within a "quoted-string", as defined in
       section 3.2.5.  Comments may nest.

       There are several places in this standard where comments and FWS may
       be freely inserted.  To accommodate that syntax, an additional token
       for "CFWS" is defined for places where comments and/or FWS can occur.
       However, where CFWS occurs in this standard, it MUST NOT be inserted
       in such a way that any line of a folded header field is made up
       entirely of WSP characters and nothing else.

       FWS             =       ([*WSP CRLF] 1*WSP) /   ; Folding white space
                               obs-FWS

       In the obsolete syntax, any amount of folding white space MAY be
       inserted where the obs-FWS rule is allowed.  This creates the
       possibility of having two consecutive "folds" in a line, and
       therefore the possibility that a line which makes up a folded header
       field could be composed entirely of white space.

     - the first bool say if we have WSP BEFORE CRLF
     - the second bool say if we have CRLF
     - the third bool say if we have WSP AFTER CRLF

     Impossible case: (true, false, true), we set to [true] the third value
     only if we found a CRLF, so the third bool __could__ be [true] only
     if the second bool __is__ [true].

     XXX(dinosaure): [FWS] is a special token about mail (according RFC 822)
     and should never occur in real/usual inputs (like value of a form). [FWS] complexifies
     the way to parse an email address at the end. However, [emile] should be used in usual
     context where input does not have any [FWS] token.

     Be aware, if you want to extract an email address from an email, we should do a first
     pass with [unstrctrd] to remove [FWS] token. Then, output can be handle by [emile].

       A quoted-string is treated as a unit.  That is, quoted-string is
       identical to atom, semantically.  Since a quoted-string is allowed to
       contain FWS, folding is permitted.  Also note that since quoted-pair
       is allowed in a quoted-string, the quote and backslash characters may
       appear in a quoted-string so long as they appear as a quoted-pair.

       Semantically, neither the optional CFWS outside of the quote
       characters nor the quote characters themselves are part of the
       quoted-string; the quoted-string is what is contained between the two
       quote characters.  As stated earlier, the BACKSLASH in any quoted-pair
       and the CRLF in any FWS/CFWS that appears within the quoted-string are
       semantically "invisible" and therefore not part of the quoted-string

        The local-part of an  addr-spec  in  a  mailbox  specification
        (i.e.,  the  host's  name for the mailbox) is understood to be
        whatever the receiving mail protocol server allows.  For exam-
        ple,  some systems do not understand mailbox references of the
        form "P. D. Q. Bach", but others do.

        This specification treats periods (".") as lexical separators.
        Hence,  their  presence  in  local-parts which are not quoted-
        strings, is detected.   However,  such  occurrences  carry  NO
        semantics.  That is, if a local-part has periods within it, an
        address parser will divide the local-part into several tokens,
        but  the  sequence  of  tokens will be treated as one uninter-
        preted unit.  The sequence  will  be  re-assembled,  when  the
        address is passed outside of the system such as to a mail pro-
        tocol service.

        For example, the address:

                           First.Last@Registry.Org

        is legal and does not require the local-part to be  surrounded
        with  quotation-marks.   (However,  "First  Last" DOES require
        quoting.)  The local-part of the address, when passed  outside
        of  the  mail  system,  within  the  Registry.Org  domain,  is
        "First.Last", again without quotation marks.

      Fron RFC 2822

        local-part      =       dot-atom / quoted-string / obs-local-part
        obs-local-part  =       word *("." word)

        The local-part portion is a domain dependent string.  In addresses,
        it is simply interpreted on the particular host as a name of a
        particular mailbox.

     Sometimes a host is not known to the domain name system and
     communication (and, in particular, communication to report and repair
     the error) is blocked.  To bypass this barrier, a special literal
     form of the address is allowed as an alternative to a domain name.
     For IPv4 addresses, this form uses four small decimal integers
     separated by dots and enclosed by brackets such as [123.255.37.2],
     which indicates an (IPv4) Internet Address in sequence-of-octets
     form.  For IPv6 and other forms of addressing that might eventually
     be standardized, the form consists of a standardized "tag" that
     identifies the address syntax, a colon, and the address itself, in a
     format specified as part of the relevant standards (i.e., RFC 4291
     [8] for IPv6).

       6.2.1.  DOMAINS

       A name-domain is a set of registered (mail)  names.   A  name-
       domain  specification  resolves  to  a subordinate name-domain
       specification  or  to  a  terminal  domain-dependent   string.
       Hence,  domain  specification  is  extensible,  permitting any
       number of registration levels.

       Name-domains model a global, logical, hierarchical  addressing
       scheme.   The  model is logical, in that an address specifica-
       tion is related to name registration and  is  not  necessarily
       tied  to  transmission  path.   The  model's  hierarchy  is  a
       directed graph, called an in-tree, such that there is a single
       path  from  the root of the tree to any node in the hierarchy.
       If more than one path actually exists, they are considered  to
       be different addresses.

       The root node is common to all addresses; consequently, it  is
       not  referenced.   Its  children  constitute "top-level" name-
       domains.  Usually, a service has access to its own full domain
       specification and to the names of all top-level name-domains.

       The "top" of the domain addressing hierarchy -- a child of the
       root  --  is  indicated  by  the right-most field, in a domain
       specification.  Its child is specified to the left, its  child
       to the left, and so on.

       Some groups provide formal registration services;  these  con-
       stitute   name-domains   that  are  independent  logically  of
       specific machines.  In addition, networks and machines  impli-
       citly  compose name-domains, since their membership usually is
       registered in name tables.

       In the case of formal registration, an organization implements
       a  (distributed)  data base which provides an address-to-route
       mapping service for addresses of the form:

                        person@registry.organization

       Note that "organization" is a logical  entity,  separate  from
       any particular communication network.

       A mechanism for accessing "organization" is universally avail-
       able.   That mechanism, in turn, seeks an instantiation of the
       registry; its location is not indicated in the address specif-
       ication.   It  is assumed that the system which operates under
       the name "organization" knows how to find a subordinate regis-
       try.  The registry will then use the "person" string to deter-
       mine where to send the mail specification.

       The latter,  network-oriented  case  permits  simple,  direct,
       attachment-related address specification, such as:

                             user@host.network

       Once the network is accessed, it is expected  that  a  message
       will  go  directly  to the host and that the host will resolve
       the user name, placing the message in the user's mailbox.

       6.2.2.  ABBREVIATED DOMAIN SPECIFICATION

       Since any number of  levels  is  possible  within  the  domain
       hierarchy,  specification  of  a  fully  qualified address can
       become inconvenient.  This standard permits abbreviated domain
       specification, in a special case:

           For the address of  the  sender,  call  the  left-most
           sub-domain  Level  N.   In a header address, if all of
           the sub-domains above (i.e., to the right of) Level  N
           are  the same as those of the sender, then they do not
           have to appear in the specification.   Otherwise,  the
           address must be fully qualified.

           This feature is subject  to  approval  by  local  sub-
           domains.   Individual  sub-domains  may  require their
           member systems, which originate mail, to provide  full
           domain  specification only.  When permitted, abbrevia-
           tions may be present  only  while  the  message  stays
           within the sub-domain of the sender.

           Use of this mechanism requires the sender's sub-domain
           to reserve the names of all top-level domains, so that
           full specifications can be distinguished from abbrevi-
           ated specifications.

       For example, if a sender's address is:

                sender@registry-A.registry-1.organization-X

       and one recipient's address is:

               recipient@registry-B.registry-1.organization-X

       and another's is:

               recipient@registry-C.registry-2.organization-X

       then ".registry-1.organization-X" need not be specified in the
       the  message,  but  "registry-C.registry-2"  DOES  have  to be
       specified.  That is, the first two addresses may  be  abbrevi-
       ated, but the third address must be fully specified.

       When a message crosses a domain boundary, all  addresses  must
       be  specified  in  the  full format, ending with the top-level
       name-domain in the right-most field.  It is the responsibility
       of  mail  forwarding services to ensure that addresses conform
       with this requirement.  In the case of abbreviated  addresses,
       the  relaying  service must make the necessary expansions.  It
       should be noted that it often is difficult for such a  service
       to locate all occurrences of address abbreviations.  For exam-
       ple, it will not be possible to find such abbreviations within
       the  body  of  the  message.   The "Return-Path" field can aid
       recipients in recovering from these errors.

       Note:  When passing any portion of an addr-spec onto a process
              which  does  not interpret data according to this stan-
              dard (e.g., mail protocol servers).  There must  be  NO
              LWSP-chars  preceding  or  following the at-sign or any
              delimiting period ("."), such as  shown  in  the  above
              examples,   and   only  ONE  SPACE  between  contiguous
              <word>s.

       6.2.3.  DOMAIN TERMS

       A domain-ref must be THE official name of a registry, network,
       or  host.   It  is  a  symbolic  reference, within a name sub-
       domain.  At times, it is necessary to bypass standard  mechan-
       isms  for  resolving  such  references,  using  more primitive
       information, such as a network host address  rather  than  its
       associated host name.

       To permit such references, this standard provides the  domain-
       literal  construct.   Its contents must conform with the needs
       of the sub-domain in which it is interpreted.

       Domain-literals which refer to domains within the ARPA  Inter-
       net  specify  32-bit  Internet addresses, in four 8-bit fields
       noted in decimal, as described in Request for  Comments  #820,
       "Assigned Numbers."  For example:

                                [10.0.3.19]

       Note:  THE USE OF DOMAIN-LITERALS IS STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.  It
              is  permitted  only  as  a means of bypassing temporary
              system limitations, such as name tables which  are  not
              complete.

       The names of "top-level" domains, and  the  names  of  domains
       under  in  the  ARPA Internet, are registered with the Network
       Information Center, SRI International, Menlo Park, California.

       Update:
       + Removed no-fold-quote from msg-id.  Clarified syntax

       The message identifier (msg-id) itself MUST be a globally unique
       identifier for a message.  The generator of the message identifier
       MUST guarantee that the msg-id is unique.  There are several
       algorithms that can be used to accomplish this.  Since the msg-id has
       a similar syntax to addr-spec (identical except that quoted strings,
       comments, and folding white space are not allowed), a good method is
       to put the domain name (or a domain literal IP address) of the host
       on which the message identifier was created on the right-hand side of
       the "@" (since domain names and IP addresses are normally unique),
       and put a combination of the current absolute date and time along
       with some other currently unique (perhaps sequential) identifier
       available on the system (for example, a process id number) on the
       left-hand side.  Though other algorithms will work, it is RECOMMENDED
       that the right-hand side contain some domain identifier (either of
       the host itself or otherwise) such that the generator of the message
       identifier can guarantee the uniqueness of the left-hand side within
       the scope of that domain.

       Semantically, the angle bracket characters are not part of the
       msg-id; the msg-id is what is contained between the two angle bracket
       characters.

       addr-spec   =  local-part "@" domain        ; global address

     From RFC 2822

       An addr-spec is a specific Internet identifier that contains a
       locally interpreted string followed by the at-sign character ("@",
       ASCII value 64) followed by an Internet domain.  The locally
       interpreted string is either a quoted-string or a dot-atom.  If the
       string can be represented as a dot-atom (that is, it contains no
       characters other than atext characters or "." surrounded by atext
       characters), then the dot-atom form SHOULD be used and the
       quoted-string form SHOULD NOT be used. Comments and folding white
       space SHOULD NOT be used around the "@" in the addr-spec.

       addr-spec       =       local-part "@" domain

       Note: A liberal syntax for the domain portion of addr-spec is

       phrase      =  1*word                       ; Sequence of words

     From RFC 2047

       (3) As a replacement for a 'word' entity within a 'phrase', for example,
           one that precedes an address in a From, To, or Cc header.  The ABNF
           definition for 'phrase' from RFC 822 thus becomes:

           phrase = 1*( encoded-word / word )

           In this case the set of characters that may be used in a "Q"-encoded
           'encoded-word' is restricted to: <upper and lower case ASCII
           letters, decimal digits, "!", "*", "+", "-", "/", "=", and "_"
           (underscore, ASCII 95.)>.  An 'encoded-word' that appears within a
           'phrase' MUST be separated from any adjacent 'word', 'text' or
           'special' by 'linear-white-space'.

       encoded-word = "=?" charset "?" encoding "?" encoded-text "?="
       charset = token    ; see section 3
       encoding = token   ; see section 4
       token = 1*<Any CHAR except SPACE, CTLs, and especials>
       especials = "(" / ")" / "<" / ">" / "@" / "," / ";" / ":" / "
                   <"> / "/" / "[" / "]" / "?" / "." / "="
       encoded-text = 1*<Any printable ASCII character other than "?"
                         or SPACE>
                      ; (but see "Use of encoded-words in message
                      ; headers", section 5)

       obs-phrase      =       word *(word / "." / CFWS)
       phrase          =       1*word / obs-phrase

       Update:
       + Period allowed in obsolete form of phrase.

     From RFC 5322

       phrase          =   1*word / obs-phrase

       Note: The "period" (or "full stop") character (".") in obs-phrase
       is not a form that was allowed in earlier versions of this or any
       other specification.  Period (nor any other character from
       specials) was not allowed in phrase because it introduced a
       parsing difficulty distinguishing between phrases and portions of
       an addr-spec (see section 4.4).  It appears here because the
       period character is currently used in many messages in the
       display-name portion of addresses, especially for initials in
       names, and therefore must be interpreted properly.

       name-addr       =       [display-name] angle-addr

       Note: Some legacy implementations used the simple form where the
       addr-spec appears without the angle brackets, but included the name
       of the recipient in parentheses as a comment following the addr-spec.
       Since the meaning of the information in a comment is unspecified,
       implementations SHOULD use the full name-addr form of the mailbox,
       instead of the legacy form, to specify the display name associated
       with a mailbox.  Also, because some legacy implementations interpret
       the comment, comments generally SHOULD NOT be used in address fields
       to avoid confusing such implementations.
